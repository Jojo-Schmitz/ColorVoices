MuseScore plugin to color the notes of each voice
----
This plug in colors the notes according to the voice. The color scheme is the same as the toolbar:

Voice 1 - Blue Voice 2 - Green Voice 3 - Gold Voice 4 - Red

You can change the colors back to black using the <a href="http://musescore.org/en/project/blacknotes">Remove Notes Color plugin</a> from <a href="http://musescore.org/en/user/4">lasconic</a>.
