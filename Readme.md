MuseScore plugin to color the notes of each voice
---

This plug in colors the notes according to the voice.
The color scheme is the same as the toolbar:

Voice 1 - Blue, Voice 2 - Green, Voice 3 - Yellow, Voice 4 - Purple

You can change the colors back to black using the [Remove Notes Color Plugin]
(http://musescore.org/en/project/blacknotes) from [lasconic]
(http://musescore.org/en/user/4).
