MuseScore plugin to color the notes of each voice
---

This plugin colors the notes (and in the 2.0 version the rests, stems, flags, beams and stem-slashes too) according to their voice.
The color scheme is the same as the toolbar:

Voice 1 - Blue, Voice 2 - Green, Voice 3 - Yellow, Voice 4 - Purple

You can change the colors back to black by either just running it again (on the same selection) or using

[Remove Notes Color Plugin](http://musescore.org/project/blacknotes).
