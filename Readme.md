MuseScore plugin to color the notes of each voice
---

This plugin colors the notes, rests, stems, hooks, beams and stem-slashes according to their voice.
The color scheme is the same as the toolbar:

Voice 1 - Blue, Voice 2 - Green, Voice 3 - Yellow, Voice 4 - Purple

You can change the colors back to black by just running it again (on the same selection) or by using [@lasconic's](http://musescore.org/user/4) [Remove Notes Color Plugin](http://musescore.org/project/blacknotes).
